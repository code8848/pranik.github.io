#### Intro

Geospatial intelligence is more important now than ever before. It is no longer a niche field for specialists; it touches almost every part of modern life. From where new businesses are built, new public infrastructure is made, to where new bike lanes and transit is added, to how cities prepare and respond to natural disasters, geospatial data has a role to play. More than half of the worldâ€™s population lives in urban areas, and that number is only expected to grow in the coming decade. This rapid urbanization, driven by economic concentration, migration, and climate pressure, demands smarter and accessible ways to manage our spaces.

The challenge is not only building livable and resilient cities but also making sure that the people involved-residents, planners, advocates, and local governmentsâ€”can access and understand the data behind decisions. Geospatial intelligence, when accessible, has the power to give small towns the same decision-making strength as big cities, empower communities to advocate for safer streets, and allow individuals to better understand their own neighborhoods.

Thatâ€™s the spirit behind Georamic.com. Itâ€™s a platform built on the belief that geospatial intelligence should not be locked away in enterprise software or available only to those with years of technical training; it should be approachable, lightweight, and accessible to everyone.

#### The Gap: Current Tools vs. Whatâ€™s Needed

There are plenty of geospatial tools out there with very powerful capabilities and really smart technical people to make use of them. There are platforms with multiple software options and some free versions, but many of the advanced and important tools are hidden behind high paywalls. On one side, we have incredibly advanced platforms like ArcGIS by ESRI, capable of everything from land-use modeling to real-time crash analysis. But these require both expertise and costly licenses-often thousands of dollars per seat, making them inaccessible for most individuals and small organizations. On the other side, we have free and familiar tools like Google Maps, which are easy to use but provide only limited insights, like commute times or traffic congestion.

Whatâ€™s missing is the middle ground: tools that are smart enough to answer real questions but simple enough for non-experts to use.

This gap shows up everywhere. Many U.S. towns donâ€™t have a single GIS specialist on staff, meaning even basic questionsâ€”like which neighborhoods lack safe access to a parkâ€”go unanswered. A parent-teacher association might want to analyze walking routes to a school, or a local advocacy group might want preliminary numbers on the impact of a proposed bike lane. Without technical expertise or expensive subscriptions, theyâ€™re left relying on anecdotes, waiting for overworked city staff, or giving up altogether.
The result is unequal access to decision-making power. Large cities and well-funded agencies can afford expert analysts and premium tools, while smaller communities, advocacy groups, and individuals are left behind.

<b>Georamic exists to bridge this gap.</b> Its vision is to take the expertise of planners, engineers, and data scientists and channel it into web-based tools that donâ€™t require training or enterprise subscriptions-tools that let anyone, from a student to a city council member, quickly get a first look at what the data says about their surroundings.

The mission statement of Georamic.com is: Towards Accessible Geospatial Intelligence-the vision of making geospatial analysis lightweight, web-based, and easy-to-use.

#### The Spark: How Georamic Started

Georamic has a beginning story like that of many 9-to-5 workersâ€”living in a new country, away from family, searching for purpose, and, truthfully, a little bored. I had to move to Boise, Idaho, for work from Austin. I knew no one in the city. I took it as an opportunity to be alone and try to create something. With the rise of AI and how it has made coding and front-end development more accessible, it felt like the right time to start creating.

The AI revolution has changed whatâ€™s possible. With an expert assistant by your side, itâ€™s easier than ever to learn, experiment, and bring ideas to life. That shift sparked the idea for Georamic: if one person could create with the help of AI, then a group of motivated people pooling their free time, domain expertise, and curiosity could build even more.

From that conviction, Georamic became a platform where engineers, planners, researchers, and developers could come together, use their evenings and weekends, ride the wave of emerging technologies, and create something meaningful.

#### The Community Approach

A vision for this platform is to build a community of valuable individuals-engineers, urban planners, developers, and data scientists who use their leisure time and unplanned weekends to build fun side projects, making geospatial intelligence more accessible along the way.

#### What Georamic Offers (Now and Soon)

This platform will host multiple tools. Each tool will have its own team, a subset of the Georamic team-working on it. If a tool proves useful enough, it can spin off into its own project with its own dedicated team.

AccessLite (in progress): An isochrone-based analysis tool. Its current focus is calculating job accessibility, points of interest, and socio-demographic information for walking and biking within a certain time budget. The goal is to add more features over timeâ€”index calculations with customizable weights, transit support, and eventually the ability for users to draw proposed pedestrian or bike paths that the tool integrates into the network. Users will be able to compare the impact of proposed paths on accessibility indexes.

School Zone Safety Tool (concept): A tool focused on recommending safety countermeasures for school zones in small and mid-sized cities. While there are many standards for crash reduction, this tool will weigh different factors based on past data and recommend measures tailored to local crash data.

Other Ideas (early stage): Using AI agents and machine learning to build a rich database of the built environment. Imagine an AI system that can generate on-demand data on speed limits, signage, traffic conditions, weather, and other built environment characteristicsâ€”quickly and accurately.
With these ideas and tools in the pipeline, we look forward to building a team of high-energy people who combine tech and domain knowledge to create something useful. We intend to release a beta version soon, with regular updates and community involvement.

Georamic is more than a platform of tools, itâ€™s about building connections and meaning.
