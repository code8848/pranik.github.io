### ðŸ‘‹ Hi


This newsletter is a personal space where I intend to Think, Learn and Build in Public. I'll be sharing thoughts, tutorials, interviews, experiments, insightsâ€”mostly around mobility, urban planning, cities, safety, AI and the future.
###### What to Expect
This newsletter will focus on three main themes:<br/>
<u><b>Emerging Tech </b></u><br/>
Making sense of AI and tech in the context of mobility, urban planning, GIS, and safety.<br/>
<u><b>People</b></u><br/>
Stories of resilience, innovation, and successâ€”through conversations and community highlights.<br/>
<u><b>Build</b></u><br/> 
Learning, teaching, and building together. Iâ€™ll share tools, resources, and side projects here.

You can find all my writings here: ðŸ”—â€‹â€‹ [pranikkoirala.com/blogâ€‹â€‹](https://www.pranikkoirala.com/blog)<br/>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">*Note on Content Authenticity: All newsletter content is written by me. I occasionally use AI for light editing or summarizationâ€”but the core ideas and writing are mine.*</span>


Thanks again for joining me on this journey!
